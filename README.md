## How it works

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2395326/129310169-b3459ac0-1114-43e6-87f6-04f80ed1336d.png" width="60%"/>


## Git branches and development
The default branch in the Github repo is `development`. However, releases are cut from the `main` branch. In general, PRs should be made against the `development` branch and reviewed by at least one other person before being merged. When ready for a release, a PR should be made from `development` to `main` and reviewed. Once happy with the PR, it can be merged and then a [release can be drafted for distribution](#automatic-github-distribution).

## Install

Make sure you are runing node 15.

```bash
yarn
```

The application is using [libnspv](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/libnspv).


## Starting Development

We do not commit libnspv to the github coz git modifies the binaries, so you need to add binaries, seed folder and a coins file to `include/binaries/libnspv`. It should have the following structure. Ask about the current coin config for the chain in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/QzWaDNd4N5).

Setting for RPC port and the coin ticker name to connect to are in `src/vars/defines.ts` file

WINDOWS
```
libwinpthread-1.dll (win dependency)
msvcrt.dll (win dependecy)
nspv.exe
coins (libnspv config file, can be copied from the libnspv repo)
seeds (libnspv specific, can be copied from the libnspv repo)
```
[windows.zip](https://github.com/TokelPlatform/tokel_app/files/6952151/windows.zip)


LINUX
```
nspv-linux
coins (libnspv config file, can be copied from the libnspv repo)
seeds (libnspv specific, can be copied from the libnspv repo)
```
[linux.zip](https://github.com/TokelPlatform/tokel_app/files/6952150/linux.zip)




MAC
```
nspv-mac
coins (libnspv config file, can be copied from the libnspv repo)
seeds (libnspv specific, can be copied from the libnspv repo)
```
[mac.zip](https://github.com/TokelPlatform/tokel_app/files/6952148/mac.zip)



Start the app in the `dev` environment:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Packaging for Production

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
yarn package
```

## Automatic Github Distribution
The `tokel_app` project has a Github Action which allows builds for Linux/Mac/Windows to be automatically built and attached as assets to a Github Release. The process is as follows:
1. Push commits as normal to Github
2. Merge `development` into `main`
3. Create a new **pre-release** release in [Releases](/TokelPlatform/tokel_app/releases). **Important**: the pre-release needs to be tagged with the same version number in `src/electron/package.json`, but with a `v` prepended. So if the version in `package.json` is `0.5.1`, the release should be tagged as `v0.5.1` (the release name can be whatever you want).
4. Creating a pre-release will trigger the `publish` Github Action, which in turn uses [Electron Builder](/electron-userland/electron-builder) to automatically build distributables for Linux/Mac/Windows and attach them to the previously created pre-release (this is why the release tag matching the package version is important).
5. Once the Github Action completes, the platform-specific packages can be downloaded/test. Once happy, change the release from a pre-release to **released**.
